In this dataset there are two table. In one table there is only ID and Executives column. 
In other table there is ID,Sales and Date column. So,now I want to create a table which will have only two columns(Executives,Sales).

Here I'm creating Data Model using three different method :
1.Relationships Tool
2.Power Query
3.Power Pivot
